  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Product Manager and Co-founder with over 3 years of experience building digital solutions that solve real problems across agriculture, education, and entrepreneurship in Africa. I co-founded ERA, an agritech platform that connects independent farmers and large farm businesses to buyers, enabling farm-to-market logistics, escrow payments, and customer engagement. I also lead Bidhaa, a learning intelligence platform that helps young Africans and startup founders validate ideas and learn business through real-world products and founder journeys.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across both startups, I have led design thinking, product architecture, MVP delivery, and operational strategy—ensuring products are not only useful, but usable by low-tech and underserved users. Iʼm applying to AltSchoolʼs Product Design program to deepen my skills in UI/UX, enabling me to prototype faster, collaborate better, and build products that combine empathy with execution.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
  <p>
    I joined AltSchool to improve my technical skills in frontend development. As someone with a product background, I wanted to learn how to build interfaces myself, collaborate better with engineers, and gain the versatility to take on more hands-on product and engineering roles. AltSchool's affordability and focus on practical learning made it the ideal choice. 
    </p>  
    <p>
    One of the most defining chapters of my career has been building and leading a startup called Bidhaa—a learning platform that connects aspiring African entrepreneurs with practical business and product knowledge. We’re building an ecosystem that equips students and young professionals with contextual tools to develop viable startup ideas. We’ve reached users across Nigeria and the UK, and the feedback has been encouraging. But leading a startup as a non-technical founder has also revealed the biggest gap in my toolkit: technical implementation.
    </p>
   <p>
    That’s why I decided to enroll at AltSchool Africa, choosing the Front-End Engineering track. It’s a strategic decision—front-end skills will not only help me build better, more intuitive user experiences for our platform, but also allow me to collaborate more effectively with engineering teams. Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React in a structured, project-based environment will give me the hands-on experience I’ve been missing. I’m ready to get my hands dirty—not just managing products, but building them.

  <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Master HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong> 
        <p>To build a strong foundation in front-end technologies, starting with HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages effectively. I will then progress to mastering JavaScript for interactivity and React for building scalable, component-based web applications. My goal is to understand not just how to use these tools, but how they work under the hood to create seamless user experiences.</p> </li>
    
    <li><strong>Build and deploy responsive web applications</strong>
    <p>I want to confidently develop websites and applications that function smoothly across different screen sizes and devices. This includes learning best practices for mobile-first design, performance optimization, and accessibility. I will also learn to deploy my projects using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, making my work live and accessible online.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Collaborate with other learners on real-world projects</strong>
    <p>Working with others will help me sharpen my communication, problem-solving, and version control skills. I plan to actively participate in group assignments, peer reviews, and collaborative projects to simulate professional work environments. These experiences will prepare me for team-based roles in the tech industry.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Secure a well-paying remote tech job by the end of the program</strong>
    <p>One of my major goals is to transition into a remote role that offers financial stability and career growth. I will focus on building a strong portfolio, gaining practical experience, and preparing for technical interviews to increase my chances of landing a remote job in tech — ideally in front-end or full-stack development.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Contribute to open-source projects and grow my portfolio</strong>
    <p>I want to give back to the tech community by contributing to open-source repositories. This will help me gain real-world coding experience, receive constructive feedback, and build credibility within the developer ecosystem. I will also document my work and publish projects in a professional portfolio to showcase my skills to potential employers.</p></li>
  </ol>
